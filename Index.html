        </header>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            <ul>
              <li>The company is the creator of the Honkai series, which consists of several games, including Honkai Impact 3rd and Honkai: Star Rail. </li>
              <li>HoYoverse also developed Tears of Themis, a free-to-play adventure game. 
                Another game that they have developed is Genshin Impact, an open-world action role-playing game, which is one of the highest-grossing mobile games of 2021.</li>
            </ul>

          <h1>History</h1>
        </header>
          <p>HoYoverse began with three computer science students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University who shared an interest in technology and ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture: Cai "Hugh" Haoyu, Liu "Forrest" Wei, and Luo Yuhao </p>
          <p>Before establishing the miHoYo name, the three have worked on projects together. Their first project was an open-source literature community which won them scholarships worth CNY 200,000 at a competition. </p>
          <p>In 2010, the team developed an isometric tile-based game engine called the "Misato Engine" or "Misato2D" using Adobe Flash Player. 
            Katsuragi Misato, a character from the Japanese franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion, inspired the name. 
            Using an upgraded version of the engine, they developed a game called Legend of Saha for a Flash game development competition held during the second China Game Developers Conference (CGDC) in July of that year. 
            The team won a cash prize of CNY 30,000 provided by Shanda Games. Shanda Games later outsourced them to develop a mini-game called Bubble Hero </p>
