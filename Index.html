            <p class="Paragraph">This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="UlLi">The company is the creator of the Honkai series, which consists of several games, including Honkai Impact 3rd and Honkai: Star Rail.</li>
                <li class="UlLi">HoYoverse also developed Tears of Themis, a free-to-play adventure game. 
                  Another game that they have developed is Genshin Impact, an open-world action role-playing game, which is one of the highest-grossing mobile games of 2021.

            <p class="Paragraph">HoYoverse began with three computer science students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University who shared an interest in technology and ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture: Cai "Hugh" Haoyu, Liu "Forrest" Wei, and Luo Yuhao</p>
            <p class="Paragraph">Before establishing the miHoYo name, the three have worked on projects together. 
              Their first project was an open-source literature community which won them scholarships worth CNY 200,000 at a competition.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">In 2010, the team developed an isometric tile-based game engine called the "Misato Engine" or "Misato2D" using Adobe Flash Player. 
              Katsuragi Misato, a character from the Japanese franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion, inspired the name. 
              Using an upgraded version of the engine, they developed a game called Legend of Saha for a Flash game development competition held during the second China Game Developers Conference (CGDC) in July of that year. 
              The team won a cash prize of CNY 30,000 provided by Shanda Games. Shanda Games later outsourced them to develop a mini-game called Bubble Hero</p>
