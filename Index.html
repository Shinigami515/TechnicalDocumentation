            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <p>The company is the creator of the Honkai series, which consists of several games, including Honkai Impact 3rd and Honkai: Star Rail.
            </p>
            <p>HoYoverse also developed Tears of Themis, a free-to-play adventure game. 
              Another game that they have developed is Genshin Impact, an open-world action role-playing game, 
              which is one of the highest-grossing mobile games of 2021.</p>

       <section class="main-section" id="History_of_hoyoverse">
            <header>History of Hoyoverse</header>
            <p>HoYoverse began with three computer science students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University who shared an interest in technology 
              and ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture: Cai "Hugh" Haoyu, Liu "Forrest" Wei, and Luo Yuhao</p>
            <p>Before establishing the miHoYo name, the three have worked on projects together. 
              Their first project was an open-source literature community which won them scholarships worth CNY 200,000 at a competition.
            </p>
            <p>In 2010, the team developed an isometric tile-based game engine called the "Misato Engine" or "Misato2D" using Adobe Flash Player. 
              Katsuragi Misato, a character from the Japanese franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion, inspired the name.
            </p>
            <p>Using an upgraded version of the engine, they developed a game called Legend of Saha for a Flash game development competition held during the second China Game Developers Conference (CGDC) in July of that year. 
              The team won a cash prize of CNY 30,000 provided by Shanda Games. Shanda Games later outsourced them to develop a mini-game called Bubble Hero

       <section class="main-section" id="Etimology_of_hoyoverse">
            <header>Etimology of Hoyoverse</header>
            <p>The letters "H" and "Y" in miHoYo's name come from the names of 2 of 3 founders, Cai Haoyu and Luo Yuhao, and the letter "O" was added based on the fact that names of famous companies such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft contain that letter. 
              Due to "HoYo" already being registered, "mi" from the VOCALOID software Hatsune Miku was prepended to the name. 
              Hatsune Miku was picked because of her popularity among otaku

            <p>In January 2011, the three students set up the miHoYo studio in the D32 university dormitory at their campus. 
              Later that year, Liu Wei, representing the group, participated in the New Entrepreneur Talents competition and won third place. 
              miHoYo was awarded a 50-square-meter office, located at No. 100 Qinzhou Road, with a term of six months and a CNY 100,000 interest-free loan 
              from the Eaglet Program of the Shanghai Technology Entrepreneurship Foundation for Graduates. 
              They moved from the dormitory to the office in December. 
              Each person had a desk against the wall, and a large table filled with comics and light novels sat at the center of the room
